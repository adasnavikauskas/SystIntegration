###Custom Shell made entirely in C.

Date Started: 11th October
Date Finished 1st Draf: 18th October

##Introduction

Welcome to the Custom Shell made by Adas Navikauskas.
The purpose of this project is to gain knowledge and experience
in developing and using my own custom shell writen in C.
It has multiple features built into it using C libraries of the
equivalent functions.

These functions have been abbreviated for ease of use.
E.g running ifc is shorthand for ifconfig eth1
This is done by having built_in strings and error checking
to see if the input is in the string list.

The main features of this shell include:

"help"
"cd"
"exit"
"ifc" -> ifconfig with default of eth1
"ifc <argument>" ifconfig with different output
        E.G ifc lo
"ud" -> UserID,GroupID,username,groupname,inode of home directory
"dt" -> date and time in a specific format

##Installation
Installation is simple and quick.
